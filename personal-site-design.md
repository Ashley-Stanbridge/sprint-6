What is my primary purpose? 
 
 To showcase my work and give an example of the kind of work i am interested in doing. to build a client base of small business owners and independent artists/contractors.  
 
Who is my target audience? Small business owners/artists/contractors, who are interested in showcasing themselves online.  
 
How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have? 
 
 As my website will be predominantly a portfolio of my own work i would like the user experience to demonstrate not only the work i have done but also generate interest for potential clients looking to set up something similar. The content will largely be photos and text posts as the functionality of the website is actually what is on display. 
 
What will you do to make your page accessible?  
 
I plan to make my site accessible to the masses by building mobile first, then build for lower end web browsers like IE and Opera before enhancing content for the likes of Firefox and Chrome. I will use the role tag to accurately label every section of this page to make it fully accessible via screen readers. 
 
How will you make your page usable? 
 
 I plan to make this page usable by working with the Philosophy of less is more. i want to keep everything very minimal and clean while still providing all the usual features of a portfolio style page. Clean code yields clean products.
